# EC 441 – Computer Networking Portfolio
Ethan Shea  
Boston University – Spring 2026  

## Overview
This repository documents my ongoing engagement with EC 441 course material.  
Each week includes an artifact (problem, lab, or report) demonstrating understanding of networking concepts.

## Generative AI Usage
I plan to use generative AI tools (including ChatGPT) to:
- Help brainstorm problem ideas
- Clarify networking concepts
- Review and critique explanations
- Improve technical writing

All final submissions reflect my own understanding and engagement with the material.
